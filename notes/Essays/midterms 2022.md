# 2022 Portland General Election Positions

## Research Process

My election research began before ballots were sent out, so in order to find out who was on my specific ballot, I went to [BallotReady.org](https://ballotready.org), created an account, and typed in my address. This presented me with a list of candidates/measures, along with some summaries of their positions and organizations that have endorsed them. Then, throughout the months leading to the election, I started reading through the various articles and voter guides listed on this page, taking notes on which arguments I found most compelling, and trying to do further investigation on the things I was most confused about.

Readers of this document should be aware that my political leaning is left-wing (in other words, in general I believe that wealth is too unevenly distributed, workers are underpowered, free markets have a lot of inherent failures, and minority groups are often marginalized due to implicit bias, explicit bias, and generational wealth). For this reason, I default to the positions selected by  left-leaning groups such as the Portland Mercury publication and the Multnomah Democrats. However, I value evidence-based policy and I am well aware that political groups "on my side" don't always make the right calls, therefore I took the time to read into counterarguments for all of the candidates and measures on this ballot. Some I did find convincing, but for more than half I went with the "progressive" vote.

If anyone is curious about my general political positions in more detail, you can take a look through my [iSideWith.com](https://www.isidewith.com/voter/33QGC2D/compare) profile.

## Governor: Tina Kotek












-----
- by default, voting for tina kotek because as a democrat i'm probably aligned with her views and style of governance
- According to my [iSideWith.com](https://www.isidewith.com/profile/4878234347/ballot) profile, I agree with Tina Kotek 89%
- [StreetRoots.org - Comparison of homelessness policies](https://www.streetroots.org/news/2022/09/23/2022-elections-oregon-gubernatorial-candidates-housing-and-homelessness/)
- The Oregonian [leans centrist according to MBFC](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oregonian/) but is [endorsing Tina Kotek](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-a-difficult-call-but-endorsement-for-governor-goes-to-tina-kotek.html)
	- "She’s demonstrated her mettle and ability to clear hurdles in trying to solve Oregon’s toughest challenges. She helped launch and allocate funding for Project Turnkey, which converts motels into temporary housing. She also sponsored and pushed through a [controversial but innovative bill](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2019R1/Measures/Overview/HB2001) that prohibits larger communities from zoning areas for only single-family homes. With a deficit of some 110,000 housing units to meet current demand, the state must encourage greater density and spur additional development."
- [NYTimes - If Oregon Turns Red, Whose Fault Will That Be?](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/opinion/oregon-governor-race.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist)
	- Offers some explanations about the homeless crisis, how it got worse under COVID, and why Brown's government has been slow to deliver on housing and mental health resources.

[christine drazan's issues page](https://www.christinefororegon.com/issues/) (7 neutral, 3 bad):
- opposing governor brown's covid-19 mandates
	- bad
- support students & parents in the classroom
- restoring public safety & the rule of law
- secure our elections
	- seems bad but i don't know yet
- addressing homelessness
	- based on everything written here, seems fine
	- "address the root causes of homelessness – addiction, mental health, and affordability"
- reduce the cost of living
	- don't agree with doing this through tax cuts and repealing regulations
- identify and prosecute waste, fraud, and abuse in government
- reestablish oregon as a great place to do business
	- based on what i see around me in portland, small businesses are doing just fine
- restore rural oregon
	- "prioritize local control and restore the voices of rural Oregonians in their state government" - maybe good
- second amendment
	- don't care either way
- end the costly cap-and-trade program
	- bad
- pro-life
	- bad

[tina kotek's](https://www.tinafororegon.com/priorities/) on the other hand go into more detail and i don't disagree with any of them


## commissioner of the bureau of labor and industries
- cheri helt
	- more experienced - served on the oregon house for 2 years, although lost re-election (R to D flip)
- christina stephenson
	- endorsed by left-leaning orgs and politicians
	- endorsed by [the oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/05/editorial-endorsements-may-2022-christina-stephenson-for-labor-commissioner.html)
	- "runs her own law firm and represents workers seeking back wages or alleging unfair labor practices or discriminatory treatment. Her experience relates directly to much of the work she would be overseeing at BOLI, which enforces wage-and-hour, overtime and other employment laws"

## oregon state senate district 17
- elizabeth, easily - the other guy is backed by anti-vax orgs (oregon moms union, oregonians for medical freedom)

## oregon house district 33

## multnomah county chair
- both candidates are already on the multnomah country board
- jessica got more votes than sharon in the primary
- haven't found any controversies regarding either candidate
- sharon was endorsed by [the oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/04/editorial-endorsements-may-2022-vote-sharon-meieran-for-multnomah-county-chair.html)
> The race for the next Multnomah County chair boils down to this: Do voters want someone who will stay the course on the county’s approach to homelessness? Or do they want someone who will bring urgency and targeted strategies to confront the totality of the crisis?
> 
 > We’ll choose the latter and recommend that voters do as well. And while both [Sharon Meieran](https://www.votesharon.com/) and [Sharia Mayfield](https://www.votemayfield.com/) demonstrate that commitment to charge forward, our endorsement goes to Meieran, a county commissioner since 2017, for the experience she brings to the table.

## City Commission Position 3
Not thrilled about either candidate

### jo ann hardesty
- **portland street response** - big win
- good to have ideological diversity in city council

- endorsed by jeff merkley
- rene gonzalez has no gov experience
- rene gonzalez reason for running is cringe:
	- He and members of the group argued that ongoing school closures would cause tremendous academic and social harm to children, a view that Oregon educators, policymakers and public health officials pushed back against at the time. The experience, Gonzalez says, was a catalyst for his decision to run for City Council.

	- gonzalez has no real policies, just says what people currently want to hear

- not on housing bureau
- permit churches for housing support
- interview on homelessness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZndJkd-k-M
- 40-50 people maximum at a camp
- eminent domian to capture land that no one plans on using
	- return to previous owners once enough housing is built
- I like having someone in city council who is thinking of innovative, non-violent, successful responses to crime: https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2022/10/10/city-commissioner-jo-ann-hardesty-defends-her-role-in-safety-at-dawson-park/?utm_source=pocket_mylist


### rene gonzalez
- [endorsed by fire department](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/09/12/portland-firefighters-endorse-jo-ann-hardestys-opponent-snubbing-their-boss/)
- hardesty took a month off during fire season despite being responsible for the fire department
- [endorsed by the Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-rene-gonzalez-is-voters-best-choice-for-portland-city-council.html) 
- [endorsed by willamette week](https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/10/19/wws-general-election-2022-endorsements-portland-city-hall/) who previously endorsed hardesty
- good supply-side views on housing (koin debate around 17:30)
- city council will be more productive

> Hardesty:
> + involvement with C3PO startup.
> + Hasn't messed up her key bureaus, transportation/maintenance & fire. (Eudaly also did not mess up transportation/maintenance)
> + Has a good network of African American community groups and progressive groups.
> + Removed a bad director of the Civic bureau, although she waited until she had the cover of the audit.
> + Proposed a study of the police special units, management, and work loading (Wheeler proposed too, but has not done it)
> + Successfully championed the police review redo initiative.
> - Has not rebuilt the Civic bureau, it is still neglected.
> - Has some red lines which make it hard to address gun violence.
> - Has fallen into the Kafoury camp on homeless services.
> - Can let critical projects within her bureaus drift or go off schedule like the slow start of Portland Street Response.
> - Has not worked to find common ground with other commissioners resulting in 4-1 council votes.
> - Was the architect of the PCEF as a consultant. While the need is there the design is flawed.
> At one time I saw her as a viable mayor. Now I think she would better in the nonprofit world.

- https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2022/11/02/46171624/homeless-portlanders-urge-city-officials-to-reconsider-mass-encampment-plan
	- "Phoenix O, who was previously homeless, said they had experienced severe transphobia and harassment within congregate shelters in the Portland metro area, and couldn’t see how the city’s plan would avoid that kind of abuse."
	- "“If you have never been in a situation like that, you will never understand\”"
- If Rene Gonzalez coupled his "sweeps" policy with a strong commitment to improving the quality of Portland's shelters (especially ones geared towards the LGBTQIA+ community), and didn't use such dehumanizing language towards the unhoused, then he might have my vote.
- jo ann: 
	- most of the shelter beds are just for one night
	- sweeps are not permanent, people always come back
	- if not here, where

# Measures
- 111: yes
- 112: yes
- 113: yes
- 114: leaning towards yes
	- could be persuaded towards no if someone presented a compelling argument that the bill would do nothing and cause the police to be unable to deal with other matters such as shootings
	- UPDATE: leaning towards no, because the "no" arguments seem more fleshed out and it being held up in courts will cost taxpayer money
	- As someone who supports basic evidence-based legislation such as universal background checks, I'm more receptive to criticisms that come from other gun control advocates than I am by gun rights groups.

### for

Homicide by 28% when Connecticut enacted theirs, and suicide by 33% when Connecticut enacted their permit-to-purchase." [Source](https://www.kezi.com/news/gun-measure-requiring-permit-to-purchase-and-banning-high-capacity-magazines-up-on-november-ballot/article_7305adc0-2b1d-11ed-ad29-63636629bac6.html)
- requires a training course
	- i just think this is a good idea in general

### against
- legal problems (large-capacity magazines)
	- not sure what the impact of this actually is; i think i'm fine with the courts handling this
> And then there are the legal problems. This bill is in direct conflict with recent supreme court decisions that prohibit licensing of firearms owners via **arbitrary criteria**. Even if it passes it will likely be tied up in court until it is found unconstitutional and struck down.

- bureaucracy
	- not sure if it's true that cops are understaffed. [mayor ted wheeler disagrees](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2022/09/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-lets-an-expletive-fly-in-frustration-as-police-staffing-woes-become-flashpoint-in-council-meeting.html)
> The cops already don’t have enough staffing to do their jobs. Measure 114 would increase their workload exponentially. This is NOT sensible gun control.

- unnecessary
	- this doesn't deal with the training requirement aspect

> This bill doesn’t really help in the background check department as they are already required and conducted by OSP. What it changes is giving local police the authority to decide who is worthy by their standards of purchasing a firearm. Additionally it sets other requirements such as licensing and training that add additional barriers making it more complicated for someone who has no mal-intent to purchase a weapon for protection. Those carrying weapons for the purpose of committing mass shootings will still find their way through this system but those with less means or perhaps critical of the police will now be forced to interact with their local police on top of paying for “permitting” which has been deemed unconstitutional already. I agree with the end goal of reducing gun violence but I also think we don’t get there by this measure. I believe to achieve that goal we need a less myopic view of the root causes.
