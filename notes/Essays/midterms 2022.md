# 2022 Portland General Election Positions

## Research Process

My election research began before ballots were sent out, so in order to find out who was on my specific ballot, I went to [BallotReady.org](https://ballotready.org), created an account, and typed in my address. This presented me with a list of candidates/measures, along with some summaries of their positions and organizations that have endorsed them. Then, throughout the months leading to the election, I started reading through the various articles and voter guides listed on this page, taking notes on which arguments I found most compelling, and trying to do further investigation on the things I was most confused about.

Readers of this document should be aware that my political leaning is left-wing (in other words, in general I believe that wealth is too unevenly distributed, workers are underpowered, free markets have a lot of inherent failures, and minority groups are often marginalized due to implicit bias, explicit bias, and generational wealth). For this reason, I default to the positions selected by left-leaning groups such as the Portland Mercury publication and the Multnomah Democrats. However, I value evidence-based policy and I am well aware that political groups "on my side" don't always make the right calls, therefore I took the time to read into counterarguments for all of the candidates and measures on this ballot. Some I did find convincing, but for more than half I went with the "progressive" vote.

If anyone is curious about my general political positions in more detail, you can take a look through my [iSideWith.com](https://www.isidewith.com/voter/33QGC2D/compare) profile.

## Federal: Wyden for Senate, Bonamici for House

The federal positions are the ones I focused the least on, for several reasons: 1) [Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/oregon/) [show](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/oregon/1/) that these two candidates are very likely to win due to Oregon being a blue state and these candidates not facing strong opposition (Despite Oregon's [gubernatorial race leaning Republican](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/), this hasn't affected the federal election polls). 2) Preserving a Democratic majority in Federal Congress is crucial for many of the issues I care about: healthcare, abortion rights, welfare, worker's rights, and more. So a Democratic candidate on the federal level would have to be _disastrously bad_ in order for me to vote against them at this point. 3) I already have a highly favorable opinion of Ron Wyden as he was one of the co-authors of the hugely important [Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230) legislation which allows free speech to exist on the internet. So for these reasons, the federal vote easily goes to the Democrats.

## Governor: Tina Kotek

Many Oregonians are disappointed with incumbent [Kate Brown](https://ballotpedia.org/Kate_Brown) as they view her as being weak on homelessness and crime, both of which have risen during the pandemic. This has caused a [surge](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/) in support for Republican candidate [Christine Drazan](https://ballotpedia.org/Christine_Drazan) and Independent centrist candidate [Betsy Johnson](https://ballotpedia.org/Betsy_Johnson), so much so that the race is currently [neck-and-neck between Kotek and Drazan](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oregon/). If Drazan wins, she would be the first Republican governor of Oregon [since 1987](https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_Oregon#Historical_officeholders). The narrative is that clearly Brown hasn't been doing her job, so Oregon needs a change in order to shake things up. ([Sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign))

I will admit that I never found this narrative persuasive. This might mean that I'm too biased towards Democrats. Maybe it's that I live in a relatively safe neighborhood that doesn't see much crime. Maybe I have a hunch that "tough-on-crime" leadership would be too cruel, and maybe that hunch isn't supported by data. Recognizing this potential bias, I tried to keep my mind open when evaluating these candidates.

When I found out about Betsy Johnson, the idea of a third-party candidate was intriguing to me. A lot of Americans complain about the two-party system and how plurality voting shuts out alternative voices. As someone who (regretably, ugh) voted for Jill Stein in 2016 instead of Hillary, I'm open to hearing the case for third parties and advocating a cultural shift towards them. Upon looking into Johnson's policies, I found she's correct on some of the [issues](https://www.runbetsyrun.com/issues) I care about including abortion rights and housing supply. And on some of the issues where she diverges from Democrats, such as opening schools back up, I'm relatively indifferent. However, there are other issues that raise alarm bells for me. Her voting record in the House has prioritized [protecting jobs over advancing crucial climate legislation](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/10/to-protect-constituents-the-timber-industry-betsy-johnson-repeatedly-voted-against-ambitious-climate-change-policy.html), and she has [voted against raising Oregon's minimum wage](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/bill/21170/55445/46663/betsy-johnson-voted-nay-passage-sb-1532-increases-minimum-wage). She currently has a [41%](http://scorecard.olcv.org/2021/senate/johnson/) score from the Oregon League of Conservation Voters when it comes to environmental policy, compared to a [95%](http://scorecard.olcv.org/2021/house/kotek/) for Kotek. She's also [against trans high schoolers competing in sports](https://www.runbetsyrun.com/issues) and talks about keeping "culture wars and politics out of our schools", which may be a right-wing [dog whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)) and is [likely to lead to banning of important history lessons](https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy). All this said, she's far from the worst candidate we could have, and there's enough alignment with Democrats that I don't believe she would be a disaster in office. If the race were only between her and Drazan, she'd have my vote.

Next, I looked into Christine Drazan. Right away, I noticed that she [refused to answer whether she believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kNOA-TeVbw). This immediately docks a few points for me, because faith in the democratic process is a at a [crucial tipping point](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/midterm-election-voters-democracy-poll.html) in this country right now and I believe it is foundational to keeping America afloat. So even if Drazan had good policies, the perpetuation of misinformation and lack of institutional trust is a serious red flag in my opinion. But I decided to look at her issues page anyway, to see if there was anything that moved me. Interestingly enough, the [issues page](https://www.christinefororegon.com/issues/) that I linked to in my notes is no longer linked anywhere on the [website](https://www.christinefororegon.com/), and has been [replaced with one](https://www.christinefororegon.com/roadmap/) that is more in-depth and focuses on a narrower amount of relatively non-controversial issues. [Abortion](https://www.mailtribune.com/top-stories/2022/10/16/candidates-for-oregon-governor-differ-on-abortion/) and [COVID](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/10/13/candidates-oregon-governor-stands-on-health-care/), both of which Drazan has disappointing views on, are nowhere to be found on this new page. Presumably, her PR team did this to preserve the independent vote and maybe even win over some Democrats. [It seems to be working](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/). However, even looking at this newer, less controversial issues page, I have some ideological disagreements with a few of the points on here (cutting taxes, "[keeping politics out of the classroom](https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy)", firing Brown's agency heads), and the other issues that I'm less informed about don't seem very different from what [Kotek](https://www.tinafororegon.com/priorities/) is also promising. Overall, Drazan offers nothing to the table and her views range from uninteresting to downright dangerous.

Onto Tina Kotek. Some might agree with the problems I've outlined with the above candidates and yet still be of the belief that Oregon's leadership desperately needs a change. Kate Brown is the nation's [least popular governor](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/new-poll-finds-kate-brown-is-nations-least-popular-governor.html), and after all, it's reasonable to be concerned about Portland's rising [homelessness](https://www.multco.us/johs/news/news-release-tri-county-point-time-count-numbers-shared-regionally-first-time-show-shifts) and [gun violence](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/81203) rates during the pandemic. I myself didn't initially have much faith in Kotek's ability to make headway on homelessness, or any of the candidates for that matter, as I believe that the issue of individuals experiencing homelessness to not want to be a part of shelters or take advantage of Portland's Housing First programs is a very difficult problem to solve. This is partially due to mental health problems that go unaddressed but also due to the fact that shelters are [often an unpleasant experience](https://invisiblepeople.tv/why-people-experiencing-homelessness-avoid-shelters/). In all honesty, I don't know what I would do on this issue if I were governor. On the surface, all of the candidates seem to have similar talking points: declare a homelessness state of emergency, fund more shelters, fund mental health resources, increase housing supply. The main differences seem to be that [Drazan](https://www.christinefororegon.com/roadmap/) and [Johnson](https://www.runbetsyrun.com/issues) focus on increasing law enforcement (despite the fact that it was the [city](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/06/portland-passes-budget-with-millions-in-cuts-to-police-spending-but-short-of-public-demand-for-50-million-reduction.html) who defunded the police, not the state of Oregon), and that [Kotek](https://www.tinafororegon.com/priorities/) is able to provide evidence of legislative accomplishments due to her role as speaker of the Oregon House. This initial investigation, in my opinion, did not necessarily prove to me that Kotek would be much stronger than the other two candidates on this issue. So initially, my vote for Kotek was mostly a signal of [my political alignment with her](https://www.isidewith.com/profile/4878234347/ballot) on the less-talked-about issues such as taxes and environmental regulations.

However, what swayed me further towards Kotek was the [endorsement piece](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-a-difficult-call-but-endorsement-for-governor-goes-to-tina-kotek.html) published by the editorial board at [The Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/), a long-standing, [reputable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oregonian/) publication that has endorsed both Democrats and Republicans in its history and is also [endorsing Rene Gonzalez](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-rene-gonzalez-is-voters-best-choice-for-portland-city-council.html) who holds somewhat right-wing views on police and crime. Since most Gonzalez voters seem to also be supporting Drazan for similar tough-on-crime reasons, The Oregonian's support for Kotek already intrigued me. Their article mentions that there was lots of debate within their board about which candidate to support and that this was their "most conflicted endorsement in recent years", but ultimately their endorsement boils down to Kotek's "record of accomplishment" and "unrivaled talent for developing specific policy solutions", both of which were news to me as someone who is not informed about Oregon politics. Kotek played a major role in increasing Oregon's minimum wage,

<!--My next step was to see what kind of centrist Johnson is running as. Maybe she's an Andrew Yang-style centrist who has some naive economic views here and there but still fights for the underprivileged? Or maybe even an Ezra Klein-style centrist who has progressive ideals but wants to blend welfare policies with efficient economics? No, unfortunately it turns out she's -->

- by default, voting for tina kotek because as a democrat i'm probably aligned with her views and style of governance

She helped launch and allocate funding for Project Turnkey, which converts motels into temporary housing. She also sponsored and pushed through a [controversial but innovative bill](https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2019R1/Measures/Overview/HB2001) that prohibits larger communities from zoning areas for only single-family homes.

- Drazan is weak on specific policy proposals

[christine drazan's issues page](https://www.christinefororegon.com/issues/) (7 neutral, 3 bad):

- opposing governor brown's covid-19 mandates
  - bad
- support students & parents in the classroom
- restoring public safety & the rule of law
- secure our elections
  - seems bad but i don't know yet
- addressing homelessness
  - based on everything written here, seems fine
  - "address the root causes of homelessness – addiction, mental health, and affordability"
- reduce the cost of living
  - don't agree with doing this through tax cuts and repealing regulations
- identify and prosecute waste, fraud, and abuse in government
- reestablish oregon as a great place to do business
  - based on what i see around me in portland, small businesses are doing just fine
- restore rural oregon
  - "prioritize local control and restore the voices of rural Oregonians in their state government" - maybe good
- second amendment
  - don't care either way
- end the costly cap-and-trade program
  - bad
- pro-life
  - bad

## commissioner of the bureau of labor and industries

- cheri helt
  - more experienced - served on the oregon house for 2 years, although lost re-election (R to D flip)
- christina stephenson
  - endorsed by left-leaning orgs and politicians
  - endorsed by [the oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/05/editorial-endorsements-may-2022-christina-stephenson-for-labor-commissioner.html)
  - "runs her own law firm and represents workers seeking back wages or alleging unfair labor practices or discriminatory treatment. Her experience relates directly to much of the work she would be overseeing at BOLI, which enforces wage-and-hour, overtime and other employment laws"

## oregon state senate district 17

- elizabeth, easily - the other guy is backed by anti-vax orgs (oregon moms union, oregonians for medical freedom)

## oregon house district 33

## multnomah county chair

- both candidates are already on the multnomah country board
- jessica got more votes than sharon in the primary
- haven't found any controversies regarding either candidate
- sharon was endorsed by [the oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/04/editorial-endorsements-may-2022-vote-sharon-meieran-for-multnomah-county-chair.html)
  > The race for the next Multnomah County chair boils down to this: Do voters want someone who will stay the course on the county’s approach to homelessness? Or do they want someone who will bring urgency and targeted strategies to confront the totality of the crisis?
  >
  > We’ll choose the latter and recommend that voters do as well. And while both [Sharon Meieran](https://www.votesharon.com/) and [Sharia Mayfield](https://www.votemayfield.com/) demonstrate that commitment to charge forward, our endorsement goes to Meieran, a county commissioner since 2017, for the experience she brings to the table.

- rene gonzalez has no gov experience
- rene gonzalez reason for running is cringe:
  - He and members of the group argued that ongoing school closures would cause tremendous academic and social harm to children, a view that Oregon educators, policymakers and public health officials pushed back against at the time. The experience, Gonzalez says, was a catalyst for his decision to run for City Council.

- If Rene Gonzalez coupled his "sweeps" policy with a strong commitment to improving the quality of Portland's shelters (especially ones geared towards the LGBTQIA+ community), and didn't use such dehumanizing language towards the unhoused, then he might have my vote.
- jo ann:
  - most of the shelter beds are just for one night
  - sweeps are not permanent, people always come back

# Measures

- 111: yes
- 112: yes
- 113: yes
- 114: leaning towards yes
  - could be persuaded towards no if someone presented a compelling argument that the bill would do nothing and cause the police to be unable to deal with other matters such as shootings
  - UPDATE: leaning towards no, because the "no" arguments seem more fleshed out and it being held up in courts will cost taxpayer money
  - As someone who supports basic evidence-based legislation such as universal background checks, I'm more receptive to criticisms that come from other gun control advocates than I am by gun rights groups.

### for

- reduces suicide and homicide (need a better source)
  > "Permit-to-purchase has been shown to reduce suicide and homicide. Homicide by 28% when Connecticut enacted theirs, and suicide by 33% when Connecticut enacted their permit-to-purchase." [Source](https://www.kezi.com/news/gun-measure-requiring-permit-to-purchase-and-banning-high-capacity-magazines-up-on-november-ballot/article_7305adc0-2b1d-11ed-ad29-63636629bac6.html)
- requires a training course
  - i just think this is a good idea in general

### against

- legal problems (large-capacity magazines) - not sure what the impact of this actually is; i think i'm fine with the courts handling this

  > And then there are the legal problems. This bill is in direct conflict with recent supreme court decisions that prohibit licensing of firearms owners via **arbitrary criteria**. Even if it passes it will likely be tied up in court until it is found unconstitutional and struck down.

- bureaucracy - not sure if it's true that cops are understaffed. [mayor ted wheeler disagrees](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2022/09/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-lets-an-expletive-fly-in-frustration-as-police-staffing-woes-become-flashpoint-in-council-meeting.html)

  > The cops already don’t have enough staffing to do their jobs. Measure 114 would increase their workload exponentially. This is NOT sensible gun control.

- unnecessary - this doesn't deal with the training requirement aspect

  > As a liberal who recently became a firearm owner, my take is this:
  >
  > When I went to purchase my gun I had to submit my fingerprints and background check to the Oregon State Police and pay $10 (I believe) for processing. It took 3 days and then I was able to return and pick up the weapon.
  >
  > This bill doesn’t really help in the background check department as they are already required and conducted by OSP. What it changes is giving local police the authority to decide who is worthy by their standards of purchasing a firearm. Additionally it sets other requirements such as licensing and training that add additional barriers making it more complicated for someone who has no mal-intent to purchase a weapon for protection. Those carrying weapons for the purpose of committing mass shootings will still find their way through this system but those with less means or perhaps critical of the police will now be forced to interact with their local police on top of paying for “permitting” which has been deemed unconstitutional already. I agree with the end goal of reducing gun violence but I also think we don’t get there by this measure. I believe to achieve that goal we need a less myopic view of the root causes.
