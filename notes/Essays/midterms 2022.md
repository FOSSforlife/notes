# 2022 Portland General Election Positions

## Research Process

My election research began before ballots were sent out, so in order to find out who was on my specific ballot, I went to [BallotReady.org](https://ballotready.org), created an account, and typed in my address. This presented me with a list of candidates/measures, along with some summaries of their positions and organizations that have endorsed them. Then, throughout the months leading to the election, I started reading through the various articles and voter guides listed on this page, taking notes on which arguments I found most compelling, and trying to do further investigation on the things I was most confused about.

Readers of this document should be aware that my political leaning is left-wing (in other words, in general I believe that wealth is too unevenly distributed, workers are underpowered, free markets have a lot of inherent failures, and minority groups are often marginalized due to implicit bias, explicit bias, and generational wealth). For this reason, I default to the positions selected by left-leaning groups such as the Portland Mercury publication and the Multnomah Democrats. However, I value evidence-based policy and I am well aware that political groups "on my side" don't always make the right calls, therefore I took the time to read into counterarguments for all of the candidates and measures on this ballot. Some I did find convincing, but for more than half I went with the "progressive" vote.

If anyone is curious about my general political positions in more detail, you can take a look through my [iSideWith.com](https://www.isidewith.com/voter/33QGC2D/compare) profile.

Note: Some Portland Mercury links don't seem to be working as of November 5, probably due to high traffic. You can access them through the Wayback Machine at [Archive.org](https://archive.org).

## Federal: Wyden for Senate, Bonamici for House

The federal positions are the ones I focused the least on, for several reasons: 
1) [Polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/oregon/) [show](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/house/oregon/1/) that these two candidates are very likely to win due to Oregon being a blue state and these candidates not facing strong opposition (Despite Oregon's [gubernatorial race leaning Republican](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/), this hasn't affected the federal election polls). 
2) Preserving a Democratic majority in Federal Congress is crucial for many of the issues I care about: healthcare, abortion rights, welfare, worker's rights, and more. So a Democratic candidate on the federal level would have to be _disastrously bad_ in order for me to vote against them at this point. 
3) I already have a highly favorable opinion of Ron Wyden, as he was one of the co-authors of the hugely important [Section 230](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230) legislation which allows free speech to exist on the internet. So for these reasons, the federal vote easily goes to the Democrats.

## Governor: Tina Kotek

Many Oregonians are disappointed with incumbent [Kate Brown](https://ballotpedia.org/Kate_Brown) as they view her as being weak on homelessness and crime, both of which have risen during the pandemic. This has caused a [surge](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/) in support for Republican candidate [Christine Drazan](https://ballotpedia.org/Christine_Drazan) and Independent centrist candidate [Betsy Johnson](https://ballotpedia.org/Betsy_Johnson), so much so that the race is currently [neck-and-neck between Kotek and Drazan](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/oregon/). If Drazan wins, she would be the first Republican governor of Oregon [since 1987](https://ballotpedia.org/Governor_of_Oregon#Historical_officeholders). The narrative is that clearly Brown hasn't been doing her job, so Oregon needs a change in order to shake things up. ([Sound familiar?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign))

I will admit that I never found this narrative persuasive. This might mean that I'm too biased towards Democrats. Maybe it's that I live in a relatively safe neighborhood that doesn't see much crime. Maybe I have a hunch that "tough-on-crime" leadership would be too cruel, and maybe that hunch isn't supported by data. Recognizing this potential bias, I tried to keep my mind open when evaluating these candidates.

When I found out about Betsy Johnson, the idea of a third-party candidate was intriguing to me. A lot of Americans complain about the two-party system and how plurality voting shuts out alternative voices. As someone who (regretably, ugh) voted for Jill Stein in 2016 instead of Hillary, I'm open to hearing the case for third parties and advocating a cultural shift towards them. Upon looking into Johnson's policies, I found she's correct on some of the [issues](https://www.runbetsyrun.com/issues) I care about, including abortion rights and housing supply. And on some of the issues where she diverges from Democrats, such as opening schools back up, I'm relatively indifferent. However, there are other issues that raise alarm bells for me. Her voting record in the House has prioritized [protecting jobs over advancing crucial climate legislation](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/10/to-protect-constituents-the-timber-industry-betsy-johnson-repeatedly-voted-against-ambitious-climate-change-policy.html), and she has [voted against raising Oregon's minimum wage](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/bill/21170/55445/46663/betsy-johnson-voted-nay-passage-sb-1532-increases-minimum-wage). She currently has a [41%](http://scorecard.olcv.org/2021/senate/johnson/) score from the Oregon League of Conservation Voters when it comes to environmental policy, compared to a [95%](http://scorecard.olcv.org/2021/house/kotek/) for Kotek. She's also [against trans high schoolers competing in sports](https://www.runbetsyrun.com/issues) and talks about keeping "culture wars and politics out of our schools", which may be a right-wing [dog whistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)) and is [likely to lead to banning of important history lessons](https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy). All this said, she's far from the worst candidate we could have, and there's enough alignment with Democrats that I don't believe she would be a disaster in office. If the race were only between her and Drazan, she'd have my vote. But with Kotek in the race, I'm not impressed by Johnson's platform.

Next, I looked into Christine Drazan. Right away, I noticed that she [refused to answer whether she believes the 2020 election was stolen from Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kNOA-TeVbw). This immediately docks a few points for me, because faith in the democratic process is at a [crucial tipping point](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/us/politics/midterm-election-voters-democracy-poll.html) in this country right now and I believe it is foundational to keeping America afloat. So even if Drazan had good policies, the perpetuation of misinformation and lack of institutional trust is a serious red flag in my opinion. But I decided to look at her issues page anyway, to see if there was anything that moved me. Interestingly enough, the [issues page](https://www.christinefororegon.com/issues/) that I linked to in my notes is no longer linked anywhere on the [website](https://www.christinefororegon.com/), and has been [replaced with one](https://www.christinefororegon.com/roadmap/) that is more in-depth and focuses on a narrower amount of relatively non-controversial issues. [Abortion](https://www.mailtribune.com/top-stories/2022/10/16/candidates-for-oregon-governor-differ-on-abortion/) and [COVID](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/10/13/candidates-oregon-governor-stands-on-health-care/), both of which Drazan has disappointing views on, are nowhere to be found on this new page. Presumably, her PR team did this to preserve the independent vote and maybe even win over some Democrats. [It seems to be working](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-could-win-oregons-governorship-for-the-first-time-in-40-years/). However, even looking at this newer, less controversial issues page, I have some ideological disagreements with a few of the points on here (cutting taxes, "[keeping politics out of the classroom](https://www.vox.com/22443822/critical-race-theory-controversy)", firing Brown's agency heads), and the other issues that I'm less informed about don't seem very different from what [Kotek](https://www.tinafororegon.com/priorities/) is also promising. Overall, Drazan offers nothing to the table and her views range from uninteresting to downright dangerous.

Onto Tina Kotek. Some might agree with the problems I've outlined with the above candidates and yet still be of the belief that Oregon's leadership desperately needs a change. Kate Brown is the nation's [least popular governor](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/05/new-poll-finds-kate-brown-is-nations-least-popular-governor.html), and after all, it's reasonable to be concerned about Portland's rising [homelessness](https://www.multco.us/johs/news/news-release-tri-county-point-time-count-numbers-shared-regionally-first-time-show-shifts) and [gun violence](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/81203) rates during the pandemic. I myself didn't initially have much faith in Kotek's ability to make headway on homelessness, or any of the candidates for that matter, as I believe that the issue of individuals experiencing homelessness to not want to be a part of shelters or take advantage of Portland's [Housing First](https://www.multco.us/housing-and-homelessness/looking-help) programs is a very difficult problem to solve. This is partially due to mental health problems that go unaddressed, but also due to the fact that shelters are [often an unpleasant experience](https://invisiblepeople.tv/why-people-experiencing-homelessness-avoid-shelters/). In all honesty, I don't know what I would do on this issue if I were Governor. On the surface, all three candidates seem to have similar talking points: declare a homelessness state of emergency, fund more shelters, fund mental health resources, increase housing supply. The main differences seem to be that [Drazan](https://www.christinefororegon.com/roadmap/) and [Johnson](https://www.runbetsyrun.com/issues) also focus on increasing law enforcement (despite the fact that it was the [city](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/06/portland-passes-budget-with-millions-in-cuts-to-police-spending-but-short-of-public-demand-for-50-million-reduction.html) who defunded the police, not the state of Oregon). However, upon further investigation through [Kotek's issues page](https://www.tinafororegon.com/priorities/), [The Oregonian's endorsement piece](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-a-difficult-call-but-endorsement-for-governor-goes-to-tina-kotek.html), and the [analysis from homeless advocacy group Street Roots](https://www.streetroots.org/news/2022/09/23/2022-elections-tina-kotek), it's clear that despite all three candidates having been members of the Oregon House of Representatives, Kotek is the only Representative with an impressive record tackling the homelessness issue. Most significant is her championing of [Project Turnkey](https://oregoncf.org/community-impact/impact-areas/housing-stability/project-turnkey/), which has provided 867 units of housing to Oregon by buying motel rooms, an increase of 20% over the previous shelter supply. [Betsy Johnson called this a mistake](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/08/16/unaffiliated-candidate-betsy-johnson-answers-opb-questions-on-homelessness-crisis/), and I didn't find her argument convincing. While homelessness is an issue that all of the candidates are paying lip service to, Kotek seems to be the only candidate with clear success stories.

Additionally, [Kotek's endorsement from The Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-a-difficult-call-but-endorsement-for-governor-goes-to-tina-kotek.html) is a clear win, as they are typically a [centrist-leaning](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oregonian/) publication that has endorsed candidates from both major parties (in fact, in this same election they also [endorsed Rene Gonzalez for city council](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-rene-gonzalez-is-voters-best-choice-for-portland-city-council.html), partially for his efforts to re-fund the police). For any ideological disagreements I might have with their editorial board, they are a [trusted publication](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/oregonian/) with very few, if any, failed fact checks. Despite their political disagreements with Democrats and the fact it was their "most conflicted endorsement in recent years", their support for Tina Kotek was strong and touted her "unrivaled talent for developing specific policy solutions" which they see as an improvement over incumbent Kate Brown.

## Oregon Measure 114 - No

Gun legislation is always a tough one for me. It's not an issue that I've dug really deeply into, but whenever I hear debates on it I realize that neither side wants to acknowledge how complex the issue is. My views on it aren't heavily swayed by the Second Amendment, in fact it's probably the Amendment that I care the least about and would not care much if it were removed. Whether good guys with guns are [successful](https://www.washingtontimes.com/multimedia/collection/good-guy-gun-stopped-bad-guy-gun/?page=1) or [not](https://time.com/6182970/good-guys-guns-mass-shootings-uvalde/) at stopping bad guys with guns is an ongoing debate with valid points on both sides. I am not an anarchist, and I'm not concerned about us needing to somehow use guns to fight off a government that has endless tanks and drones at their disposal. But if I lived in a sketchy area where my house was likely to get broken into, or had a high percentage of political terrorists who carried out hate crimes, I'd probably want some way to protect myself and my property that didn't rely on waiting for the cops to show up. Common-sense reforms such as universal criminal background checks and banning weapons that are intended for the military rather than self-defense are generally good ideas, but many policies that sound good on paper [fail to be effective](https://reason.com/2022/06/08/would-these-4-gun-controls-prevent-mass-shootings/) and end up wasting time and taxpayer dollars. So going into this measure, I have no strong bias one way or the other.

[Measure 114](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_114,_Changes_to_Firearm_Ownership_and_Purchase_Requirements_Initiative_(2022)) would create new requirements for gun buyers: safety training, criminal background check, and a permit approved by local law enforcement. It would also ban magazines larger than 10 rounds, like the one used by the shooter at Safeway in August. The safety training and background check requirements seem like a no-brainer to me. There is [already a background check in place](https://www.oregon.gov/osp/Docs/WhatToExpect032018.pdf) for Oregon gun buyers, however this would close the loophole of being able to finish the purchase if the background check is taking too long. [The Oregonian](https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2022/10/editorial-endorsement-november-2022-vote-yes-on-measure-114s-gun-safety-reforms.html), [Willamette Week](https://www.wweek.com/news/2022/10/19/wws-general-election-2022-endorsements-ballot-measures/), and [Portland Mercury](https://www.portlandmercury.com/endorsements-2022/2022/10/20/46139379/mercury-general-election-2022-endorsements-state-and-federal#measure114) have all written op-eds supporting the bill. 

While some of these changes to Oregon's gun laws are welcome and overdue at this point, there are some concerns when digging deeper. [Multnomah Democrats](https://multdems.org/a-message-about-measure-114/), [Portland Mercury](https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2022/10/25/46154347/oregon-is-poised-to-pass-the-strongest-gun-law-in-the-us-with-measure-114), and [PDX.Vote](https://pdx.vote/november-2022-general-election-voters-guide/#state) have drawn attention to the way permits would be granted-- through *local* law enforcement. And as Mercury reports, the Portland Police Bureau has a history of [racially biased targeting](https://www.opb.org/article/2021/02/07/portland-has-5th-worst-arrest-disparities-in-the-nation-according-to-data/) and [ties to alt-right groups](https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2019/02/14/25885836/texts-show-protective-relationship-between-portland-cops-and-patriot-prayer). The Oregonian reports that they have [repeatedly not met use-of-force compliance standards](https://oregonlive.com/portland/2022/07/portland-police-slipping-further-from-compliance-with-settlement-justice-department-finds.html) and that they [let an officer off the hook for Nazi worship](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2014/07/portland_police_capt_mark_krug.html). This is not the ideal organization for deciding who does or doesn't own firearms, especially when this bill states that permits can be refused under the [vague criteria that someone is a "danger to self or others"](https://sos.oregon.gov/admin/Documents/irr/2022/017text.pdf). As activist Athul Acharya [explains](https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2022/10/25/46154347/oregon-is-poised-to-pass-the-strongest-gun-law-in-the-us-with-measure-114), “The best world is the world in which almost no one has a gun. The worst world is one in which the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer have guns, and no one else has a gun. This measure, I think, gets us closer to that world.” Personally, I don't think it would be that drastic. But it is likely to create some disparity, and that could mean lack of self-defense for some Black and Brown Oregonians, potentially costing people their own lives.

The other major counterargument is that the magazine limit may not be Constitutional under our current federal courts. Just recently, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (which Oregon falls under) [struck down a California law banning high-capacity magazines](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/14/902676422/federal-appeals-court-throws-out-california-ban-on-large-capacity-gun-magazines), claiming that it would "substantially burden \[Americans'\] core right of self-defense". It's likely that Measure 114 would run into the exact same issue, therefore getting tied up in the courts and wasting taxpayer dollars. Surprisingly, few outlets are talking about this (I only saw it mentioned on [PDX.Vote](https://pdx.vote/november-2022-general-election-voters-guide/#state), in [Reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/yfokdp/comment/iu4lqgh/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and on [Stop 114](https://stop114.com/ballot-measure-114-a-bad-idea/)), but I see it as a valid argument.

Some [groups](https://www.oregonfirearms.org/stop-114) are claiming that in between the law's passing and its implementation, *all* gun purchases will be temporarily banned in Oregon. This doesn't seem likely to me, and [this OPB article](https://www.opb.org/article/2022/10/18/oregon-measure-114-gun-laws-permits-safety-class-magazine-limits/) offers a good explanation of how things generally work: "While the state might place a moratorium on gun purchases until the new system was in place, such a move would be almost immediately challenged in courts as unconstitutional, according to Ofer Raban, a constitutional law professor at the University of Oregon. It is more typical in situations where voters approve a law that requires a new state-run system that the Oregon State Police would issue an exception to needing to participate in a new system until that system was up and running."

Overall, Measure 114 seems like a mostly fine bill that addresses some long-awaited holes in Oregon's gun legislation, but has a few glaring flaws. If I believed that the potential benefit (reduced gun violence) outweighed the potential costs (minorities facing discrimination when applying for firearm permits, time and resources being held up in courts), then I would vote for it. Right now, it's hard to tell if that will be the case. My vote is slightly towards "No", with the hope that the next election introduces a better version of the bill that doesn't have these flaws.

## City Commission - Jo Ann Hardesty

Perhaps the most controversial race on the entire ballot is the city council race between 
newcomer [Rene Gonzalez](https://ballotpedia.org/Rene_Gonzalez_(Oregon)) and incumbent progressive activist [Jo Ann Hardesty](https://ballotpedia.org/Jo_Ann_Hardesty). 

Rene Gonzalez is best known as the co-founder of [ED300](https://ed300.org/), a group advocating for the reopening of schools in response to Kate Brown's COVID-19 lockdowns. On its face, I have no major issues with this proposal. As long as kids are required to be vaccinated, I think a partial reopening with days in and days out is probably a good idea, as there have been kids who are set back by in-home learning. COVID policy is always going to be a balance between safety and freedom, and it's not an easy decision to make. One of ED300's methods has been to endorse campaigns of various Oregon school board candidates who support the vision of reopening schools. However, ED300 has [come under fire lately](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2022/10/portland-commissioner-jo-ann-hardesty-supporters-skewer-challenger-rene-gonzalez-over-his-groups-conservative-ties.html?outputType=amp) because some of these school board members are aligned with conservative groups. So in advancing the cause for school reopening, Gonzalez has inadvertently helped school board candidates who are backed by groups such as anti-abortion [Oregon Right to Life](https://www.ortl.org/) and anti-vax [Oregon Moms Union](https://www.oregonmomsunion.com/novaccinemandate). Gonzalez defends these endorsements, not because he agrees with their views, but because they are aligned with the goal of school reopening, so he sees it as a fair trade-off. Personally, I'm mixed on this. It's clear that he really, really cares about the school reopening issue, and that it's a personal issue for him as he has kids of his own, so I can understand wanting to do everything in your power to promote this cause even if it causes collateral damage. In addition, one could make the argument that if a liberal school board candidate is worried about losing their election to a conservative, all they would have to do is pledge to be in favor of school reopening and they could get an endorsement from ED300 as well. That said, part of me does see this as a reckless move, and I sympathize with parents who are having to deal with a conservative school board because of ED300's influence. Ultimately, this issue is not a dealbreaker for me.

More central to Gonzalez's campaign, and more relevant to his role on City Council, are his views on homelessness and crime. Like Mayor Wheeler and gubernatorial candidates Drazan and Johnson, Gonzalez promises to build shelters while also criminalizing those who don't want to be sheltered and calling for more law enforcement. He occasionally uses language that I consider extreme and dehumanizing, such as that "our city is overrun and under siege" (an [op-ed published by Multnomah Democrats](https://multdems.org/on-rene-gonzales-and-democratic-values/) called him out on this).

Jo Ann Hardesty, on the other hand, focuses her rhetoric and policies on treating the homeless with respect and care while mitigating gun violence through nonviolent methods. Her biggest accomplishment

  - As someone who supports basic evidence-based legislation such as universal background checks, I'm more receptive to criticisms that come from other gun control advocates than I am by gun rights groups.

### against

- legal problems (large-capacity magazines) - not sure what the impact of this actually is; i think i'm fine with the courts handling this

  > And then there are the legal problems. This bill is in direct conflict with recent supreme court decisions that prohibit licensing of firearms owners via **arbitrary criteria**. Even if it passes it will likely be tied up in court until it is found unconstitutional and struck down.

- bureaucracy - not sure if it's true that cops are understaffed. [mayor ted wheeler disagrees](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2022/09/portland-mayor-ted-wheeler-lets-an-expletive-fly-in-frustration-as-police-staffing-woes-become-flashpoint-in-council-meeting.html)

  > The cops already don’t have enough staffing to do their jobs. Measure 114 would increase their workload exponentially. This is NOT sensible gun control.

- unnecessary - this doesn't deal with the training requirement aspect

  > As a liberal who recently became a firearm owner, my take is this:
  >
  > When I went to purchase my gun I had to submit my fingerprints and background check to the Oregon State Police and pay $10 (I believe) for processing. It took 3 days and then I was able to return and pick up the weapon.
  >
  > This bill doesn’t really help in the background check department as they are already required and conducted by OSP. What it changes is giving local police the authority to decide who is worthy by their standards of purchasing a firearm. Additionally it sets other requirements such as licensing and training that add additional barriers making it more complicated for someone who has no mal-intent to purchase a weapon for protection. Those carrying weapons for the purpose of committing mass shootings will still find their way through this system but those with less means or perhaps critical of the police will now be forced to interact with their local police on top of paying for “permitting” which has been deemed unconstitutional already. I agree with the end goal of reducing gun violence but I also think we don’t get there by this measure. I believe to achieve that goal we need a less myopic view of the root causes.
