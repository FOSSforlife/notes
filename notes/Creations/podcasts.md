## Solutions
Main site: https://medium.com/solutions

**Solutions** is a podcast/community hosted by me and my friend Grant where we discuss the most effective ways to solve societal problems. In addition to the audio, we publish a written version via Medium.

The podcast is on hiatus, but we now host a weekly [article discussion](https://medium.com/solutions/introducing-article-discussions-42debdaa42f6) in Discord where we  go over news articles and blog posts about current events and interesting ideas.

## Listening Circle (2019-2021)
Listening Circle was a podcast where my friends and I would discuss all things music, usually reviewing recent albums from bands that we like.

You can find all the episodes, as well as a "greatest hits" compilation, on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtM9VzujJ4bK-82xIi0vKFQ).
