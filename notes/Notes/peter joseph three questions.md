> 1) Given the market economy requires consumption in order to maintain demand for human employment and further economic growth as needed, is there a structural incentive to reduce resource use, biodiversity loss, the global pollution footprint and hence assist the ever-increasing need for improved ecological sustainability in the world today? 
- I can think of two incentives, although it's difficult to say how strong these are. (Peter eventually acknowledges these, but refers to them as "external" rather than "structural", which I don't understand because we are all part of the political, societal, and economic structure):
	1. **Politicians** being incentivized to respond to the people's demands (which often include these items) through the promise of re-election.
		- Assuming that we live in a functioning democracy ([as recent research would indicate to be true](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study)), then this structural incentive is working, and this would be an adequate response to Peter's question. 
	2. **Businesses** being incentivized to be eco-friendly through market pressure.
		- Of course, we're all familiar with the counterarguments involving the incentives that businesses have to continue polluting and to [persuade the public](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled) that [what they're doing is actually green](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/). But it's still worth noting that there are incentives on both sides of this.
	- A better question that Peter could have posed is, "are this structural incentives stronger than the incentive that businesses have to destroy the planet in the name of profit?" This is a more challenging question that I think gives room for fruitful debate.

> 2) In an economic system where companies seek to limit their production costs (“cost efficiency”) in order to maximize profits and remain competitive against other producers, what structural incentive exists to keep human beings employed, in the wake of an emerging technological condition where the majority of jobs can now be done more cheaply and effectively by machine automation?
- None, however the premise is flawed. Job takeover by machine automation has been predicted time and time again, and what actually ends up happening is that our jobs end up becoming more sophisticated, our products evolve over time as we pour our labor into research and development, and we work towards solving more of the world's problems over time. Automation can and does send shocks to the labor market, and it's best that we continue to absorb those shocks through unemployment benefits and other stimuli, but there is still lots of manual work to be done in the world, and there will be for a very long time.

> 3) In an economic system which inherently generates class stratification and overall inequity, how can the effects of “Structural Violence” - a phenomenon noted by public health researchers to kill well over 18 million a year, generating a vast range of systemic detriments such as behavioral, emotional and physical disorders – be minimized or even removed as an effect?
- It seems like he's mostly referring to the effects of poverty. Eliminating poverty is a [UN goal](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1) and is likely possible under capitalism, although addressing it in the developing world seems to have more to do with [geopolitical issues and internal corruption](https://exponentsmag.org/2020/07/18/no-jeff-bezos-cant-end-world-hunger) than it does with supply and policy on our end.
