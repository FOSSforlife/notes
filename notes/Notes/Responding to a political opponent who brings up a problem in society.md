# Responding to a political opponent who brings up a problem in society

Your options are:

-   **Acknowledge:** Agree that the problem exists, and perhaps disagree with them on the solution
	-  “I want less abortions too, that’s why I support birth control and better sex ed”
-   **Downplay:** Agree that the problem exists, but say that it’s being blown out of proportion and it’s actually not worth discussing 
	-  “Antifa randomly killing that Trump supporter was bad, but that was a one-off 😅 it won’t happen again I promise”
-   **Deflect:** Ignore the question about the problem, but point out that the opponent has other positions that are contradictory (a.k.a. ad hominem or whataboutism)
	-  “You don’t like capitalism? Hahaha iPhone Starbucks 😎🔥 DESTROYED”
	-  “You’re mad about gas prices? Why aren’t you mad about prescription drug prices too? Fuckin got em”
-   **GIGACHAD:** Acknowledge that it’s happening, but deny that it’s a bad thing
	-  “Yeah, whites are becoming a minority in the US. Based 👌🏽”
-   **Gish gallop:** Rapidly switch between the above options based on what’s convenient for your argument at the time (most common)
	-  “Critical Race Theory is just a different perspective bro, there’s 100% absolutely nothing wrong with it… except for the times when it’s harmful and toxic, but that’s ok because it’s not being taught in elementary schools… Ok yeah, there are elements of it that are making their way into elementary schools, but if you really cared about improving education you’d advocate for better funding. Haha got em checkmate conservatives destroyed stay mad 🔥♟😎👌🏽”
