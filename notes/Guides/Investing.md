# Investing
I use two apps for investing my money, **Stash** and **Acorns**. I highly recommend everyone set aside some of their money for this, as you will almost definitely make more than if your cash sits in a savings account. Markets do crash sometimes, as we've seen recently, but as long as you're choosing safe investments, you're still going to do well, especially in the long run. I've been using both of these apps since 2019.

## Acorns

Acorns, unlike other investing apps, does most of the work for you. Your money goes into a balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and treasuries, based on a risk level that you specify (e.g. Moderate, Aggressive). 
- It includes a short-term and a retirement (IRA) account, and you can choose when and how to put money into each one.
- You can automatically add money on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, and also do "round-ups" based on your spending (e.g. if you eat a $5.75 lunch, it'll add $0.25 to your account). This makes it easy, allowing me to constantly grow my account without having to think about it.
- They also offer a checking account and debit card that rewards you in stocks every time you buy something with it.
- Their app and website both have [guides](https://www.acorns.com/money-basics/) on how investing works and how to make the most with your money.
- When you create a profile, you can see a graph that shows your projected earnings if you keep saving over time.

If you sign up with [my referral link](https://share.acorns.com/ejthedj0) and make your first investment, I get a little bit of cash.

## Stash

Stash is more of a conventional investing app - you make decisions on which stocks and ETFs you want to invest in, and you choose when to buy and sell them. It's more risky than Acorns, but potentially more rewarding. It works similarly to Robinhood (I think, I've never used it).

It includes **all of the features** I mentioned in the bullet points above for Acorns (separate accounts for short-term and retirement, recurring payments, and a debit card rewards program) - the main difference is that you choose which investments to make, whereas Acorns decides for you. However, Stash does analyze your portfolio and offer suggestions on how to make it more balanced.

As with Acorns, if you sign up with [my referral link](https://get.stash.com/eliasux2l6) and make your first investment, I get a little bit of cash, and it'll also give you some free stock to start out with ($20 at the time of writing this).

## Others
I also have a little bit of crypto in Coinbase. There's a [referral link](https://get.stash.com/eliasux2l6) for that too if you're interested. I wouldn't recommend it though. I don't think crypto is going back up anytime soon.

Eventually I'll talk to my credit union about other investment opportunities. I should probably do that soon. Haven't gotten around to it. That said, these apps all work pretty well and have given me great returns over the past few years.
