# Music Production
## I want to make music on my computer. Where do I start?
[E-Home Recording Studio](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com) is, in my opinion, the definitive (and free) online guide for learning what tools you'll need for music production. It covers everything from DAWs to interfaces, micrphones, controllers, etc, and tells you what you'll need at each stage of your music production journey, from beginner to pro. 

It has six chapters, which don't need to be read in order:
1. [The 9 Home Recording Studio Essentials for Beginners](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/home-recording-studio-essentials/)
2. [The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Recording Studio Microphones ](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/types-of-microphones/)
3. [The Ultimate Guide to Acoustic Treatment for Home Studios](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/acoustic-treatment-101/)
4. [How to Set Up Your Recording Room](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/home-recording-studio-design/)
5. [Audio Recording 101 for Home Studio Musicians](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/home-recording-101/)
6. [The Complete Recording Studio Equipment List](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/recording-studio-equipment-list/)

## This guide says I need to pick a DAW. Which one should I pick?
Your DAW (e.g. Logic Pro, Ableton, Pro Tools, REAPER) is where your music lives - it's essentially the operating system that houses all of your projects and plugins, and you'll be using it for recording, mixing, mastering, sketching ideas, and possibly sound design. So it's important to find a DAW that you're comfortable with and that enables you to be productive.

Personally, I use a mix of [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) and [REAPER](https://reaper.fm). These are actually the two that I recommend checking out first. **Ableton Live** is the industry standard for electronic music, but is often used in other genres as well. Musical ideas can be created as loops (a.k.a. clips) which you can then play back and re-arrange at will, enabling you to sketch out ideas quickly and even jam and perform live using a method called [live looping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urJEdDXOIf8). **REAPER**, on the other hand, is a well-known DAW focused on linear recording and editing, and at $60 (discounted license that applies to most people) it comes with the most bang for your buck. It runs well on almost any computer, its customization and scripting features are unmatched, and it has everything you need to record your entire band and create solid, professional mixes. I would highly recommend checking these two out as your starting point, or just one of them depending on what looks more interesting to you.

Choosing a DAW is a very personal decision. What works for others might not work for you. Below are some other DAWs that might also be of interest, but **be warned!** Every day that you spend going down the rabbit-hole of trying out different DAWs, is a day you could be spending making music. My suggestion is, before you spend too much time looking at other DAWs, check out the two that I mentioned and see if one or both of them work for you.

<details><summary>Other popular DAWs besides Ableton and REAPER</summary>
<p>

- [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com), [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/) for loop-based/electronic music
- [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/), [Studio One](https://www.presonus.com/products/Studio-One) for a more linear workflow
	- Recently Logic has released a clip launcher feature which is supposed to be similar to Ableton, although I haven't tried it yet.
- [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools) is what you'll almost certainly be using if you are taking college courses or plan on working in a professional studio. If those don't apply to you, I wouldn't recommend this one.
- [Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) and [Ardour](https://ardour.org) are free, which I guess is cool. A good DAW is a worthwhile investment though, so you should be willing to shell out some cash.

## Do I need a Mac?
No. 

Don't get me wrong-- I **love** my M1 Max MacBook Pro. MacOS is a rock-solid operating system that handles audio seamlessly, the new Apple Silicon chips are absolute beasts, and MacBooks in general tend to last 5-10 years which makes them a great investment. And the M1 MacBook Airs for $1,000 are probably the best bang for your buck at that price compared to anything else on the market.

But as long as your laptop isn't slow to the point of being sluggish, it should be able to handle most audio processing just fine. Computers have come a long way, and audio processing doesn't require a huge amount of power. If you really want to upgrade to something nicer than what you have, I do think a Mac is a great option, but you'd also be fine with any new-ish Windows PC. Just go with what you like most.

## How do I get started in REAPER?
[Download the 60-day trial here](http://reaper.fm/download.php) if you haven't already.

The videos on [REAPER's website](http://reaper.fm/videos.php) are an excellent resource to start with. If you prefer reading, you can also check out the [REAPER User Guide](http://reaper.fm/userguide.php).

## How do I get started in Ableton?
[Download the 90-day trial here](https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/) if you haven't already.

The [Setup](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/learn-live/setup/) and [Interface](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/learn-live/interface/) sections of Ableton's "Learn Live" page contain helpful video tutorials to get you started. The [manual](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/welcome-to-live/) is also very well-written and will tell you just about everything you need to know.

## I don't know any music theory!
That's okay! Historically, a lot of people have made great music just by trying stuff out and learning as they went along.

The [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com) site by Ableton is a great resource for getting started with music theory. It goes over beats, notes, scales, chords, basslines, melodies, and song structure.

Ableton also has a free book of musicmaking techniques that will work in any DAW, called [Creative Strategies for Electronic Music Producers](https://makingmusic.ableton.com/). I've read the whole thing and found it very inspiring.

## What plugins do I need to download?
**My suggestion is to first learn what effects and instruments your DAW comes with.** Every DAW comes with the basics: EQ, compressor, sampler, synth, etc. Ableton in particular comes with some fantastic synths and creative effects if you have the Suite edition. That said, there are a wide variety of amazing plugins out there, and you'll definitely want to pick some up as time goes on. 

### Free Plugins
- [Komplete Start](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-start/) - a Native Instruments bundle that comes with lots of free sampled instruments, as well as the free version of Guitar Rig 6 (a collection of virtual guitar amps).
- [Spitfire LABS](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com) - More sampled instruments.
- [Vital](https://vital.audio) - A powerful wavetable synthesizer that you can use to make leads, pads, basses, FX, etc.
- [Sitala](https://decomposer.de/sitala/) - a drum sampler that you can add your own sounds to (not necessary if you're using Ableton, since that comes with Drum Machine).
- [AFreeStudio.com](https://AFreeStudio.com)
- [Bedroom Producers Blog: Free VST Plugins](https://bedroomproducersblog.com/free-vst-plugins/)
- [Free REAPER Plugins](https://youtu.be/2W8gbpfxwiM)

### Paid Plugins
- [Toontrack EZDrummer](https://www.toontrack.com/product/ezdrummer-2/) - high-quality sampled drums for rock and metal
- [Rift](https://www.minimal.audio/products/rift) - my favorite distortion plugin. I can spend all day making creative and transformative effects with this.
- [iZotope Neutron](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/neutron.html) - A mixing chain that comes with an EQ, compressor, exciter, and gate. Ableton comes with pretty good mixing plugins already, but I use this with REAPER a lot. The visual feedback and the AI features do a lot to speed up my mixing workflow.
- [Sononym](https://www.sononym.net) - technically not a plugin since it's a standalone program that runs outside of the DAW. This is an AI-powered sample manager that analyzes, compares, and organizes all of your sounds, and you can drag samples into your DAW for instant use. 

## Do virtual guitars, amps, drums, etc sound as good as the real thing?
You'll get different answers from different people on this.

My personal opinion is that guitar amp plugins sound really good, and I personally *prefer* them to real amps because they're cheap, versatile, and I can use them in my apartment without noise complaints. I've had guitarist friends use [Bias FX](https://www.positivegrid.com/bias-fx/) at my place during jam sessions and they were always happy with the metal presets. Other plugins like [Helix Native](https://line6.com/helix/helixnative.html) and [Archetype: Gojira](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-gojira) can produce crushing tones that sound just as awesome as anything "real" I've heard.

Virtual instruments are a bit harder to get right. Two of my favorite albums, [Meshuggah's Catch ThirtyThree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Thirtythree) (2005) and [Animals as Leaders' titular album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_as_Leaders_(album)) (2009), were made with programmed drums and I think they sound great. Some guy on the internet made an entire [10-hour stream of AI-composed metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqvmUnG25dA) using just virtual instruments and I think that sounds really good too. A lot of really impressive guitar and bass plugins from companies like [Shreddage](https://impactsoundworks.com/series/shreddage-3-series/) and [Submission Audio](https://www.submissionaudio.com/products/eurobass2) have come out lately, and when used right they can sound very convincing. That said, this is definitely a skill that takes work. Unless you're working with loops that have already been programmed for you, chances are it'll take time to learn how to program good-sounding guitars and drums. Personally, I struggle with getting virtual guitars and basses to sound good, but I've gotten pretty good at drum programming (it helps that I actually play drums). It's up to you whether you want to take the time to develop this skill or just learn the instrument, and there's no shame in either option. 

## How do I get good at mixing and mastering?
Honestly, I don't know. I'm pretty bad at it. But I would assume that, just like with any skill, practice is key. 

There are a few websites where you can get "stems" (audio tracks that haven't been mixed yet) and use them to practice mixing in your DAW. [reaMIXed](https://reamixed.com) is a monthly competition that gives out stems each month for free and accepts mixes that are made in REAPER. [Nail the Mix](https://www.nailthemix.com) is the same concept, but includes stems and mixing tutorials from dozens of famous bands like Knocked Loose and Periphery.

Speaking of Periphery, they also sell [stems of their albums](https://store.periphery.net/products/hail-stan-full-album-stem-download) that you can use for mixing practice if you're into their music.

There are thousands of tutorials on YouTube that show you how to make a mix from start to finish and explain various techniques. I'd recommend checking these out, and also doing some of your own searching:
- [In the Mix - Mixing Start To Finish: A Step by Step Guide to Balanced Mixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRzMby4PXzc)
- [The REAPER Blog - Mixing Rock with REAPER Stock Plugins](https://youtu.be/WQZ0nivlCvQ)
- [FakeSmileRevolution - Metal Mixing Workflow Explained](https://youtu.be/sTHchdBoSKQ)

The REAPER Blog also has a [full paid course](https://reaperblog.net/courses/) on his website on mixing in REAPER, and ADSR Courses has a [similar course](https://www.adsrsounds.com/product/courses/a-beginners-guide-to-mixing-with-ableton-live-10/) on mixing in Ableton. That said, most mixing tips you see can be applied to any DAW.

## Where can I find loops and samples?
### Free
- [MusicRadar - over 70,000 samples organized by category](https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-royalty-free-loops-hits-and-multis-to-download)
- [Freesound.org - huge repository of user-uploaded samples](https://freesound.org)

### Paid
- [Splice](https://splice.com/sounds)
- [Noiiz](https://www.noiiz.com)
- [Loopcloud](https://www.loopcloud.com/cloud/)

## How do I publish my music once it's finished?
- Use [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) for sharing with others. People will be able to hear it for free, share with their friends, and follow your profile to hear your latest uploads when they come out.
- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) is the best platform for selling digital and physical copies of your music. It has a massive community of independent artists, partly due to the fact Bandcamp only takes [10-15%](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007902213) of artists' revenue, half of the 30% that similar storefronts like Amazon Music and iTunes take. And as of COVID, they've also started hosting [Bandcamp Fridays](https://isitbandcampfriday.com) every few months, where all of the money from purchases goes to the artists that day.
- [Distrokid](https://distrokid.com/) seems to be the go-to platform these days for getting your music on streaming services and digital storefronts. They let you keep 100% of the royalties for a small annual fee of [$20 or $35](https://bestfriendsclub.ca/is-distrokid-free/) depending on which plan you choose, and they put your music on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and all of the other popular platforms. I know several people who use their services and I've never heard any complaints about it.
- [Resonate](https://resonate.is) advertises itself as "the ethical music streaming co-op". They use a "stream to own" system where users pay a small amount per stream and then "own" the song once they've listened to it 9 times, and they also offer co-operative ownership in the company to artists who use their platform. It's a really unique idea that could potentially solve a lot of problems in the music industry, and I'd love to see it take off. The problem right now is that it hasn't received very much press and isn't anywhere close to a critical mass of users. If the idea sounds interesting to you, definitely check it out and support it.
