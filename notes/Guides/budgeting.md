# Budgeting

I recently made a command-line script that helps me track my personal expenses.Â I'll write something about it here soon.

My main advice is: if you're like me and get two paychecks a month, but pay rent on a monthly basis, **pay half of your rent every paycheck**. That way your budget is more consistent each pay period, which makes it easier to control your spending.
