# Torrenting
:::caution Work in Progress

Eventually I'll add more info in here about automated tracking, app comparisons, VPNs, etc.

I do not condone piracy! This is doc purely for **educational purposes.**

## Downloading files
1. Get a VPN and enable it before doing anything.
2. [Download qBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org).
3. [Install search plugins](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Install-search-plugins).
4. Before downloading anything, **enable your VPN.**
5. Verify that you're VPN is working properly using the **Torrent Address detection** on [ipleak.net](https://ipleak.net). 
6. **With the VPN enabled,** use the search engine inside qBitTorrent to search for content, and double-click any item to download.

## Setting up a streaming server
1. On your computer (or a dedicated home server if you have one), download and install [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) (most common, best device support) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) (an open source alternative, works on most but not all platforms). Follow the instructions to set up your media folders.
2. Download the Plex or Jellyfin apps on your phone, TV box, etc. Access your server either by logging in or using the IP address of your computer/server.
