# Elias's Notes

This is where I keep documents that I'd like to be publicly available, but don't really belong on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@eliasjackson) or anywhere else.

This site is split into sections, available on the lefthandsidebar:

- **Essays:** Long-form pieces that are intended to be read top to bottom. Some of them are pulled from Facebook posts, some are eventually going to become Medium articles, and some are just things that I've written casually in my free time. If you're looking for higher-quality/finished writing, you can check out my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@eliasjackson).
- **Lists**: Lists for everything! I love making lists of all the things in my life. It helps me keep everything in one place.
- **Notes**: Documents I use to jot things down for myself and others. They share similar qualities to the essays and lists above, but are less structured.
