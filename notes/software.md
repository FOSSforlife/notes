# Software and Services I Use

## Coding

- Docker
- Ngrok
- Visual Studio Code
  - Argdown
  - ES7 React
  - Mermaid
  - REST Client
  - Spotify

## Command Line

- zsh - Seems to have a better toolset than bash, including:
- Oh My Zsh - Plugin system for zsh. The plugins I use are git, copydir, copyfile, copybuffer, history, macos, and web-search.
- Powerlevel10k - Really cool zsh prompt that looks fancy and displays useful info, including hostname, node version, git branch, and most importantly, time length of every command. Includes a configuration wizard which makes it really easy to setup.
- iTerm2 - The terminal emulator that I use on my laptop.
- [Meslo Nerd Font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k) - The terminal font recommended by Powerlevel10k.
- bitwarden-cli
- gh
- jq
- mdcat
- ncdu
- neovim
- mas

## Media Consumption

- Plex - I use this on my home server to host movies and TV shows that aren't on other streaming services.
- VLC - I use this for all locally stored audio and video files.
- Spotify - My primary (and only) music listening service. Even when I buy albums on Bandcamp to show my support, I still use Spotify for all my listening. I've been on it for over 10 years, and obsessively create playlists for all of my moods. I find their recommendation algorithms incredibly useful, and I [don't buy the idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szSff7TUkv8) that Spotify's existence is a net harm to artists.

## Investing

- Acorns - Super easy. Just throw money in there, choose a risk level, and watch your money grow. You don't choose which stocks to invest in. I like this because I don't have to think about it. For specific stocks, I use Stash. [Referral link](https://share.acorns.com/ejthedj0)
- Coinbase - I have a little bit of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some others that I leave in here in case they go up. Coinbase is better than a lot of the alternatives because you [actually own your crypto and can transfer it to other wallets](https://blog.trezor.io/why-you-should-not-use-paypal-for-bitcoin-f6e2d436ca96). However, there are other alternatives that allow this as well, I just don't know a lot about them. [Referral link](https://www.coinbase.com/join/jackso_afs)
- Stash - Similar to Robinhood, this is what I use to invest in specific stocks. [Referral link](https://get.stash.com/eliasux2l6)

## Media

- YouTube Premium
- Twitch (with Turbo)
- Hulu Plus Ad-Free - Where I watch most TV.
- Netflix - They have Seinfeld now! And a bunch of other stuff.
- HBO Max

## Social Media

- Discord - For chatting with friends and online communities. There are good open-source alternatives out there like [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) and [Element](https://element.io), but no one uses them.
- Twitter - Mostly for following journalists and keeping up with internet drama.
- Facebook - I don't use this as often as I used to, but I appreciate that it's one of the only major social media platforms left that lets you make long text posts.
- Instagram - This is where everyone is nowadays, so I mostly use it to contact new people I meet.

## Software Development

- AWS - I actually don't use AWS very often. Since all of my personal projects are small, I generally prefer to use simpler alternatives that are easy to use and manage costs.
- Beeceptor - Useful mock API service with customizable endpoints.
- Digital Ocean - This is what I use for all my VPSes (virtual private servers). Their pricing service
- GitHub - I considered switching to GitLab when the Microsoft buyout happened, but the network effect of being engaged with so many open source projects is largely what kept me on GitHub.
- Heroku
- MongoDB Atlas - Free, easy-to-use database for my hobby projects. I especially like that you can manually edit documents in the web browser, and that it now comes with its own data API.
- Netlify - For static website hosting.
- Ngrok
- Vercel - For hybrid web app hosting, especially for Next.js projects.
