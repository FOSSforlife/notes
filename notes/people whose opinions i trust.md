# People whose opinions I trust

## Preface
This is a list of people whose opinions and summaries(?) I often seek out when learning about issues. 

Part of the reasoning behind this trust has to do with **shared moral values**. I am a [consquentialist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/), therefore I value arguments that have an implied goal of **good outcomes**, above other types of moral values such as justice.

# List

## Steven Bonnell a.k.a. "Destiny"
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/destiny) | [Positions](https://positions.destiny.gg)

### Reasons I trust this person
- He cares about doing research and finding accurate information on topics. He's made several videos about his process, and has demonstrated this process on stream when preparing for debates.
	- [Destiny Joins A College Zoom Call](https://youtu.be/PeMa_jqAtkA) - A lecture he gave about his research process and mindset
	- [Example of one of his research streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZCP-PFp3HM) (on Joe Rogan's COVID claims)
		- [Another example](https://youtu.be/urvF8f3yiqc) (prep for Lauren Southern debate)
- Makes arguments from first principles of morality and epistemology
	- [In-depth description of his moral system and thought process](https://youtu.be/N-eTcjGsK08) 
- He has changed his mind on a number of issues. One recent example is his opinion on political corruption. A larger example is his gradual shift from believing in libertarianism to a supporting a mixed economy with regulations and safety nets.
	- [Questioning My Politics and Admitting My Mistakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w835bc2pY48)
		<!--anti-interventionism-->
- He doesn't typically hold strong opinions on a given issue until he has some knowledge about it. It's very common for him to answer a question with "I don't know, I would have to look at the data".
- He refrains from making absolute statements, instead using words like "probably" and phrases like "the data currently seems to support X". This is good because it demonstrates a willingness to change his opinion and an understanding that much of our knowledge is built on assumptions.

### Flaws
- He's very self-centered and doesn't often show empathy for people
	- [Response to his friend Trihex trying to have a heart-to-heart](https://youtu.be/cQqmiyR6riE?t=70)
- He sometimes has trouble understanding other people's thought processes and restating people's arguments
	- [This entire conversation with Hasan](https://youtu.be/ctAsIoNJmlw)
	- In his conversation with Digibro discussing a [previous debate](https://youtu.be/Am-wMjclso0), Digibro [argues that you can "bring up a good point without substantiating it"](https://youtu.be/utDoE_DT1XA?t=593). What he meant by "bring up a good point" was to state something that is true. What Destiny meant by that phrase was to put forth a sound argument. Because of this misunderstanding and because Destiny wasn't able to glean from context what Digibro was trying to say, they mostly talked past each other throughout this 45-minute conversation.
	<!--- In this discussion with Sargon of Akkad, he [interprets Sargon's argument](https://youtu.be/1NjdIyo6y8Y?t=1612) as saying that culture has *no* influence on the differences between men and women's career choices, when he actually said that culture does have an influence but not a major one. -->
	- I didn't jot down a timestamp for this, but in his [Islam discussion](https://youtu.be/7rZ-4uZLpNY) I took this note:
	  > “are you saying that families/hierarchies can’t exist in liberalism?” - this fails to recognize the difference between an ideology in its current existence and an ideology taken to its logical conclusion

<!-- - Tone-deaf about how he comes across-->

## Ezra Klein
### Reasons I trust this person
- He shows much more willingness than his contemporaries in journalism to extend olive branches to the other side. Examples are him inviting prominent [socialists](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-thomas-piketty.html) and [conservatives](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-erika-bachiochi.html) onto his podcast, [appearing on Ben Shapiro's show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMOUiWCjkn4) to have a polite yet honest discussion, and his [exchanges with Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org/blog/ezra-klein-editor-chief).
	- In addition, his book Why We're Polarized demonstrates a passion for wanting people to understand each other's values and see eye-to-eye.
- Co-founded [Vox](https://www.vox.com), which I believe to be the most well-rounded and thoughtful publication within the progressive left, featuring articles that provide wide-ranging and controversial perspectives on [rent control](https://www.vox.com/22789296/housing-crisis-rent-relief-control-supply), [UBI](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/13/18220838/universal-basic-income-ubi-nber-study), and [America being an oligarchy](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/9/11502464/gilens-page-oligarchy-study).
	- Aligns with my moral values, namely in his advocacy for [a plant-based diet](https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/1389355128549904384?lang=en) and effective altruism.
- Provided one of the best [critiques](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ezra-klein-journalism-most-important-topics/#biggest-critiques-of-the-effective-altruism-and-rationalist-communities-012040) of the rationalist/effective altruist movement that I've heard:
> People really want you to perform as if you are a human computer, and if somebody comes and they’re yelling, and they’re upset, and they’re crying, or whatever the online equivalents are, there can be a real like, “Oh, ho, ho, ho. You’re not having a rational argument with me.” Not being able to hear people who are upset and not being able to hear people who haven’t been trained in the particular style of argumentation that you favor is a way of missing super important information about the world."

### Flaws
None that I've found so far.

## Unnatural Vegan
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/UnnaturalVegan)

### Reasons I trust this person
- Much of her channel is focused on calling out flawed arguments by fellow vegans. This leads me to believe that rationality and truth are things that she truly believes in, more so than being profitable on YouTube or unconditionally promoting veganism.
- Whenever she makes controversial content that attracts criticism, she addresses the criticism in long follow-up videos that don't seem to misrepresent their arguments and don't seem to be cherry-picked.
	- Socialism
	- Fat
- Uses utilitarian reasoning which allows her to have nuanced views on many topics, including some [controversial opinions within veganism such as that eating eggs can sometimes be ethical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y0tDfHI69w).

### Flaws
- Used to promote a "raw food" diet, even writing a book about it which she has since unpublished and [made a full debunking of](https://youtu.be/rObOkDaizjI). It's good that she's walked this back and learned from her research mistakes, but it's a little bit strange that she was sucked into this fad to begin with.

## Julia Galef
[Website](https://juliagalef.com) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/measureofdoubt)

### Reasons I trust this person
- Her book, The Scout Mindset, is about developing mental strategies toward open-mindedness and truth-seeking, and was one of my favorite reads.
	- Parts of her book are dedicated to counterarguments, which she demonstrates a clear understanding of and doesn't straw-man.
	- While writing this book, she completely re-wrote entire sections because she started to recognize flaws in some of the studies and arguments that she had used. That demonstrates a high level of thoughtful self-critique and truth-seeking.
- Frequently seeks out opinions that are outside of her bubble
	- ["Unpopular ideas"](https://juliagalef.com/2017/08/23/unpopular-ideas-about-social-norms/) series of articles
	- [Tweet](https://twitter.com/juliagalef/status/1195395309649580032) asking for antifa perspectives

### Flaws
- Called Coleman Hughes the only rational person speaking on the police brutality issue

## David Pearce
[Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/David-Pearce-18)

### Reasons I trust this person
- Demonstrates an understanding of several different perspectives when writing about a complex issue. The best examples are in his many Quora answers regarding the [nature of matter and consciousness](https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-the-panpsychist-view-that-everything-has-an-element-of-consciousness/answer/David-Pearce-18), where he explores different theories and why they might be right or wrong, while revealing which ones he believes to be more likely true.
- Seems to spend a great deal of his time interacting with online strangers and discussing these issues. He's active in many Facebook groups involving effective altruism, utilitarianism, and his Hedonistic Imperative project. He accepts friend requests from everyone, including me.
	- Of course, much of his time is also spent in discussions with [other philosophers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkyOmY74mKY).
- Does a lot of writing which is published for free online, including a comprehensive, very well-structured [essay](https://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html) on negative utilitarianism that addresses most, if not all, of the common criticisms against it. I've referred to it several times when examining my own beliefs. Due to the amount of time spent freely writing and engaging with others on moral philosophy without any monetary benefit to himself, I'm led to believe that Pearce cares deeply about these issues.

### Flaws
None that I've found so far.

# Other people
These are people who are often associated with the people mentioned above, and may be added to the list once I feel more confident about them. Some of these people I have issues with. I'm not sure yet if these issues are real and indeed evidence that these people should generally not be trusted, or if they are just a result of my biases. 

## Dylan Matthews
[Vox](https://www.vox.com/authors/dylan) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dylanmatt)
### Things I like
- Agrees strongly with my values: Futurist, vegan, Effective Altruist, [donated one of his kidneys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7EglP5A2Hg). Talks about all of these things in his Future Perfect publication.
- Writes detailed articles about economics, two of which are among my all-time favorites for the way that they express multiple viewpoints in a relatively unbiased way:
	- [Bill Gates tweeted out a chart and sparked a huge debate about global poverty](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/12/18215534/bill-gates-global-poverty-chart)
	- [How I (and US policymakers) got inflation wrong](https://www.vox.com/22996474/inflation-federal-reserve-nairu-ngdp-powell)
	- [The case against billionaire philanthropy](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/17/18141181/foundation-charity-deduction-democracy-rob-reich)

## Sam Harris
[Website](https://www.samharris.org)

### Things I like
- During his [conversation](https://www.samharris.org/blog/the-limits-of-discourse) with Noam Chomsky, he wanted to start out by laying down the moral foundation of what they'd be discussing. Chomsky seemingly wanted to skip ahead to the topics of discussion-- "war, terrorism, state surveillance, and related topics". The two clearly have different ways of speaking about these issues, and while I might agree more with Chomsky on the issues themselves, I do really like Harris's approach of nailing down the moral framework first and the policy implications second. In my opinion, this is a rational way to tackle issues.
- Went against much of his fanbase in 2016 by holding firmly to his support of Hillary Clinton and consistently harshly criticizing Trump.
- Admitted to having an initial bias *against* Charles Murray-- that he must be a racist-- and was willing to have his mind changed after reading some of his work.
	- An important note: Even if you disagree with Harris's current opinion, as I do, it's still worth pointing out that he did change his mind. I have no reason to believe that he's lying about this.

### Things I don't like
- He's built much of his [career](https://www.amazon.com/The-Moral-Landscape-Sam-Harris-audiobook/dp/B0045XWQ32) on rebranding utilitarianism without seeming to know much of the philosophical literature behind it and the arguments against it. He demonstrates this whenever he confronts the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem), which he conveniently assumes isn't a problem, for example in this [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/SamHarrisOrg/status/951276346529009665), his [discussion](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/what-is-moral-progress) with Peter Singer, or his [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj9oB4zpHww) where he relies on intuition and hyperbole to make bold claims about morality being objective.

## Scott Alexander
[Blog](https://astralcodexten.substack.com)

### Things I like
- Writes detailed posts about topics and seems to do a good job of showing all sides and providing clear arguments
- Considered one of the leading bloggers in the rationalist movement and has done a lot to promote critical thinking and epistemic humility. Popularized the term "motte and bailey", which is when someone makes a strong version of a claim and then only defends the weak version of it in their argument.
- His [short piece](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/07/yes-we-have-noticed-the-skulls) on rationality was part of what introduced me to the concept and the movement. I read it before I knew who Scott was or what the rationalist movement was, but this echoed a lot of my internal frustrations with political discourse at the time.

### Things I don't like
- His disdain for "woke culture"/"SJWs", while having valid points at times, resulted in [this overdramatic article](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/advice-for-unwoke-academic) which labels crusading against college campus "wokeness" (a term which is never defined in his post) as a "fight for academic freedom" and displays a lack of understanding about the strong cultural response to George Floyd's killing.
- While I appreciate his attention to detail, it also means that most of his articles are way too long for my attention span. If you're going to write with this much detail, I generally like to see more organization, ideally in the form of section and sub-section headers.

## Against Unreason
### Things I like
- Writes detailed posts about topics and seems to do a good job of showing all sides and providing clear arguments

### Things I don't like
- While his writings are typically well thought-out and insightful, he gets extremely defensive and sometimes irrational when he's confronted via comment responses.

## Derek Parfit
### Things I like
- Wrote a series of books (On What Matters) tackling and combining ethics from all three major branches: consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. I haven't read this yet, but the mere fact that it exists (and is very long and thorough) is likely evidence that he has really thought through this issue from many different perspectives and considered all of their implications.
	- Some people have criticized this book for basically circling back to consequentialism. I don't know if this is accurate or not.

## David Pakman
### Things I like
- Has acknoledged when he was wrong in his journalism and made videos correcting himself
	- [COP26 climate change summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTYmzewFpTI)
	- [Russia-Ukraine mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGs5avBgAsg)

### Things I don't like
- Isn't above selling himself out for money. He's spent huge chunks of episodes covering irrelevant Trump news after he was out of office, and he [often has sponsors who promote cryptocurrency and could be shady](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/ox264v/david_pakman_is_promoting_crypto_scams_to_his/).
- Sometimes [fails to understand perspectives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjcpTOsoqw) put forth by people who disagree with him

## Noam Chomsky
### Things I like
- Doesn't shy away from criticizing the left, usually on how to strategize for the best outcomes. This has made him polarizing and controversial within his own groups. Despite being an anarchist, he [recognizes](https://youtu.be/3qFWGE1oDoA) that we have to do what we can in the real world today and is a pragmatist.
- Holds academia in high value and has [used this to debunk 9/11 conspiracy theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b_nI6DlZP0)

## Rose Wrist
### Things I like
- Very data-driven in his arguments
- Consistently open to new ideas and feedback, and dedicated to logical consistency, both of which were demonstrated in his [veganism discussions](https://youtu.be/LbjZ1bznr0A)

## Dylan Burns
### Things I like
- Compared to other political streamers, Dylan:
	- Has experience as a policy adviser and an activist
	- Speaks in-depth about foreign policy issues instead of regurgitating headlines
	- Does a great job moderating debates to keep things civil and balanced between opposing sides, not letting his biases get in the way
	- Engages in freelance journalism and activism, including [covering the Jan 6 insurrection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohluKpSKfuo), [canvassing for Warnock and Ossoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cfz8CbkoY) and [traveling to Poland to interview Ukrainian refugees](https://twitter.com/DylanBurns1776/status/1508598339679494146)

## Rebecca Watson
### Things I like
- Has been part of the skeptic movement for a long time (the original, science-focused one, not the anti-SJW YouTube fad. Think [/r/skeptic](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic) or [The Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org)) and makes insightful videos from this perspective about science, politics, and social issues. She generally offers a perspective that I either haven't heard before or that is more helpful than other pieces on the subject that I've read or watched.
