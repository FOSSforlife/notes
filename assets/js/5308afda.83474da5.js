Right now, I believe that center-left (Democratic) economic policy can bring prosperity, reduce suffering, and eventually end poverty (which is a goal currently set in place by the United Nations). I\u2019ve read multiple articles that state that material conditions around the world are consistently getting better, not worse, even with capitalism being the pervasive economic system in all of these countries. Most of the nice things that socialism offers can also be done through a combination of government programs and charity, and perhaps better so. Post-capitalism will not be achievable or desirable until we make grand technological leaps that I may not see until very late in my lifetime, at which point we may naturally transition into it (and why wouldn\u2019t we, if it ends up being better than our system in every way?)

This is something I\u2019ve changed my mind on very recently. The reason that our representatives do a horrible job of representing us is two-fold. The first problem, which most people acknowledge, is the influence of corporate lobbying in politics. We need stricter legislation against that. While this may seem like a circular issue and therefore unsolvable, here's why I don't believe that's the case. If enough people decided to unite on that issue, pressure our politicians, and take that opinion with them to the polls, it would get solved. You know what that requires? VOTING. (Which is the second issue). Politicians only care about representing the people who vote for them, because that\u2019s their incentive for re-election and a successful political career (it would be nice if they simply did the right things without us needing to be involved and use our votes as an incentive, but this is how the game is played). Voter turnout in this country is ABYSMAL, and it honestly makes me embarrassed for our country. We cannot pretend that \u201cwe\u2019ve tried democracy/electoralism and it failed\u201d when it\u2019s clear from the numbers that most of you guys have in fact not tried it.
