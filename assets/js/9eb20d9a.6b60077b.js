That all it takes to combat dangerous beliefs is to simply educate the masses. I had sympathy for even the worst people, believing that most people have the desire (even if not the will or ability) to be open-minded, rational, and empathetic. I would argue against the people on my side who said that fascists can't be reasoned with, claiming that the (although this wasn't the term I used) \"marketplace of ideas\" would let the best ideas win out. While I still believe in the importance of open discussion and hearing multiple sides of issues (as long as all sides are being heavily fact-checked and evaluated for rational arguments), my recent experiences have shown me that many people do not approach politics with the goal of having correct positions, but instead to further their personal agenda.
