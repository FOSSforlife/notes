this is almost done. I&#x27;ve decided not to go super in-depth on all the different moral theories as that would be beside the point I&#x27;m trying to make. (I might do that in future essays, though.) I&#x27;ll have to change up the intro since the essay diverted a bit from what I initially intended it to be.</p></div></div><p>Often times when discussing politics, I&#x27;ve found that there are disagreements that can be difficult to resolve, even when we agree on the facts. What I&#x27;ve found is that many of these disagreements boil down to the ethical assumptions that each of us are using to reach our conclusions. In order to know what a &quot;good&quot; policy, behavior, or economic system is, we first have to define &quot;good&quot;. In this article, I will attempt to explain how I come to my conclusions about morality, and how this affects my worldview.</p><p>Below are examples of some of my views. Some of these, you may agree with, and others you may find strange or unconventional. In order to understand them, you must understand my moral philosophy:</p><ul><li>No sentient being should ever be made to suffer unless there is no way around it. Unnecessary pain and suffering includes: animals in factory farms, &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot;, poverty, harsh forms of punishment, etc. This also includes <a href="https://www.animal-ethics.org/wild-animal-suffering-section/wild-animal-suffering-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wild animals who constantly suffer</a> from malnutrition, disease, harsh weather conditions, and more.</li><li>Retributive &quot;justice&quot; is <em>never</em> a reason to harm someone. (Punishment which prevents future harm, however, can be.)</li><li>Markets, government, hierarchy (including workplace hierarchy), and wealth inequality are not inherently unethical, although any of these taken to an extreme will usually result in unnecessary suffering, and I think that in the future we could see all of these things eliminated or transformed entirely.</li><li>A techno-utopian future where humans are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTMS9y8OVuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">super-intelligent, free of despair, and have the option to live forever</a>, is a desirable goal.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-quote-on-suffering">A quote on suffering<a class="hash-link" href="#a-quote-on-suffering" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This is a quote from one of my favorite philosophers that beautifully summarizes the moral reasoning that I&#x27;m about to dive into:</p><blockquote><p>Let&#x27;s say I find myself in agony because my hand is on a hot stove. That agony is intrinsically motivating, even if my conviction that I ought to withdraw my hand doesn&#x27;t follow the formal canons of logical inference.</p><p>If one takes the scientific world-picture seriously, then there is nothing ontologically special or privileged about here-and-now or me - the egocentric illusion is a trick of perspective engineered by selfish DNA.</p><p>If it&#x27;s wrong for me to be in agony, then it is wrong for anyone, anywhere.</p><ul><li>David Pearce
(<a href="https://www.abolitionist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li></ul></blockquote><p>In the following sections, I will use two premises to reach the conculsion that we should care about the well-being of all sentient creatures.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="premise-1-my-well-being-matters">Premise 1: My well-being matters.<a class="hash-link" href="#premise-1-my-well-being-matters" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/1263894994726711298/1590175037/1500x500" alt="Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal - 2013-08-15" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Before arguing that all suffering is wrong, I find it easiest to start with the claim that <em>my own</em> suffering is wrong. This is different from saying that I don&#x27;t like to suffer-- that would be an &quot;is&quot; statement (describing facts of the matter)--here I am making an &quot;ought&quot; statement, that my well-being <em>should</em> be protected.</p><p>Right off the bat, I&#x27;ll say that this is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axiom</a>--a premise that I have an intuition about, but have not proven to be true. I can&#x27;t make a rational argument that my own well-being is important in a way that properly bridges the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is-ought gap</a>, however this is one of my most deeply-held beliefs, and not believing this would lead to an absurd existance where any action done towards me, no matter how harmful, could be morally neutral or justified. I cannot imagine an existence where this axiom is not true.</p><p>In philosophy, arguments sometimes have to start from unjustified premises, and unfortunately this is one of those cases. However, I don&#x27;t think this is a controversial claim (maybe some people don&#x27;t think that <em>my</em> well-being matters, but they can just substitute themselves into the claim instead and hopefully they&#x27;d agree). I find the next premise more interesting, and I hope the logic from this point forward makes a clear case for my thesis.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="premise-2-i-dont-matter-more-than-anyone-else">Premise 2: I don&#x27;t matter more than anyone else.<a class="hash-link" href="#premise-2-i-dont-matter-more-than-anyone-else" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We&#x27;ve established that my well-being matters, yet as I&#x27;ve said, I don&#x27;t have a reason for why that is. However, by eliminating some potential reasons, we can arrive at another realization.</p><ul><li><p><em>My well-being matters because I&#x27;m human.</em></p><ul><li>This claim might feel natural, because we generally tend to recognize humans as members of society, as moral agents, and as people who deserve well-being. But I haven&#x27;t seen a good argument as to why being human necessarily means I deserve well-being any more than if I were a different species that had its own thoughts and feelings.</li></ul></li><li><p><em>My well-being matters because I&#x27;m me.</em></p><ul><li>Ethical egoism argues that what is morally right is defined by each person fulfilling their own desires. Essentially, if you want something, then it&#x27;s ethical for you to have it.</li><li>Of course, if our goal is for a moral system to be <em>objective</em>, it must be consistent. So this can&#x27;t possibly work. People are going to have competing interests, and if our moral system says that everyone must pursue their interests, it&#x27;s going to have contradictions when different people want different things. Thus, ethical egoism is insufficient grounds for arguing that my well-being matters.</li></ul></li><li><p><em>My well-being matters because I&#x27;m a good person.</em></p><ul><li>There is no good argument for saying that <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desert/#Justice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who act well deserve better than people who act badly</a>, especially if we accept determinism-- the belief that we don&#x27;t really make any of our own choices.</li><li>The argument that creating this type of society is good because it benefits people is circular reasoning-- you first have to define what is good.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We&#x27;ve eliminated all potential reasons that separate me from others to justify my well-being. I still don&#x27;t know what the reason is that my well-being matters, but this process of elimination has led me to the conclusion that, if I ever do find a justification for my own well-being, it would likely justify everyone&#x27;s well-being. In other words:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion-everyones-well-being-matters">Conclusion: Everyone&#x27;s well-being matters.<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion-everyones-well-being-matters" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Because there is no rational way to justify my own well-being above others, yet I know that my own well-being is ethically significant, I must conclude that everyone&#x27;s well-being matters. If I ever do find a rational justification for Premise 1, I would expect that argument to also logically follow for everyone who isn&#x27;t me. Furthermore, if someone wanted to argue for <strong>moral nihilism</strong> (the idea that well-being doesn&#x27;t matter), they would have to denounce Premise 1 and state that <em>their own</em> well-being doesn&#x27;t matter. The adherence to this claim could be tested by placing the person&#x27;s hand on a hot stove.</p><p>Another way to wrap your head around this concept is to use a thought experiment referred to by John Rawls as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veil of ignorance</a>&quot;. Imagine that you are about to be born into the world, and you have no idea what country you will live in, what your social status will be, or even what species you will belong to. Now try to construct this world in a way that, regardless of where these circumstances land, enables you to propser and live a good life. This way of thinking ensures that you are considering everyone&#x27;s well-being when making moral decisions.</p><p>We&#x27;ve answered the basic question of why we should care about others, and why we should create a world where everyone (specifically, every living thing that is capable of having <strong>well-being</strong>) can prosper. But what are the rammifications of this? What should we actually do with this information? This is where we turn to moral philosophy. There are many different philosophies around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to be moral</a>, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what well-being even means</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering-focused_ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how we value pain vs. pleasure</a>, whether or not we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free will</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how that impacts moral responsibility</a>, and much more. It&#x27;s a huge field with lots of debate and discussion on all of the different issues. </p><p>However, even without delving into philosophy and wrestling with these difficult questions, there are some basic prescriptions we can make once we accept that everyone&#x27;s well-being matters.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contributing-to-everyones-well-being">Contributing to everyone&#x27;s well-being<a class="hash-link" href="#contributing-to-everyones-well-being" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It follows from my argument that everyone should contribute to making the world a better place for all living organisms, as long as they can do so without causing themselves great harm. In case you&#x27;re still not convinced of this, consider the &quot;drowning child&quot; thought experiment:</p><blockquote><p>To challenge my students to think about the ethics of what we owe to people in need, I ask them to imagine that their route to the university takes them past a shallow pond. One morning, I say to them, you notice a child has fallen in and appears to be drowning. To wade in and pull the child out would be easy but it will mean that you get your clothes wet and muddy, and by the time you go home and change you will have missed your first class.</p><p>I then ask the students: do you have any obligation to rescue the child? Unanimously, the students say they do. The importance of saving a child so far outweighs the cost of getting one’s clothes muddy and missing a class, that they refuse to consider it any kind of excuse for not saving the child. Does it make a difference, I ask, that there are other people walking past the pond who would equally be able to rescue the child but are not doing so? No, the students reply, the fact that others are not doing what they ought to do is no reason why I should not do what I ought to do.</p><p>Once we are all clear about our obligations to rescue the drowning child in front of us, I ask: would it make any difference if the child were far away, in another country perhaps, but similarly in danger of death, and equally within your means to save, at no great cost – and absolutely no danger – to yourself? Virtually all agree that distance and nationality make no moral difference to the situation. I then point out that we are all in that situation of the person passing the shallow pond: we can all save lives of people, both children and adults, who would otherwise die, and we can do so at a very small cost to us: the cost of a new CD, a shirt or a night out at a restaurant or concert, can mean the difference between life and death to more than one person somewhere in the world – and overseas aid agencies like Oxfam overcome the problem of acting at a distance.</p><ul><li>Peter Singer (<a href="https://newint.org/features/1997/04/05/peter-singer-drowning-child-new-internationalist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</li></ul></blockquote><p>That said, it can be stressful to think about all the suffering in the world and in our own communities and how to even begin to address it. It&#x27;s easy to feel hopeless that your efforts will actually accomplish anything, because you&#x27;re only one person, and the world is a harsh place with many ongoing problems.</p><p>However, the truth is that we each have an impact on the world through our actions every day, from immediate actions such as greeting someone with a smile or giving a few dollars to a person experiencing houselessness, to indirect actions such as participating in the economy, voting in elections, donating to a cause, or creating art.</p><p>The question is, how do we do the most with our contributions? Peter Singer, who created the thought experiment above, inspired a movement called <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Altruism</a>, which advocates &quot;maximizing the good you can do&quot; through charitable donations and lifestyle choices such as veganism. It&#x27;s affiliated with a charity evaluation organization called <a href="https://www.givewell.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GiveWell</a>, which conducts rigorous research on organizations that save the most lives per dollar. There is an <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online community</a> of effective altruists who are constantly discussing and organizing on ways to do the most good, which is filled with lots of brilliant ideas and back-and-forth debates. And over the past decade, the movement has grown to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/8/23150496/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-dustin-moskovitz-billionaire-philanthropy-crytocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise billions of dollars</a> to preventing diseases, transferring cash to people in extreme poverty, mitigating existential risks, and protecting animal welfare. Thousands of individuals have signed the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giving What We Can</a> pledge to donate at least 10% of their income to effective charities, and you can <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up here</a> if you&#x27;re interested.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that Effective Altruism is the best movement for doing good. It&#x27;s <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections#objectionsto-effective-altruism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ page</a> lists some common critiques, such as that it doesn&#x27;t focus enough on systemic issues that could make a bigger difference in the long term. In addition, some scholars <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/17/18141181/foundation-charity-deduction-democracy-rob-reich" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reject charity in general</a> as being undemocratic. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/07/29/against-against-billionaire-philanthropy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Others disagree</a>, and I think that GiveWell does a <a href="https://www.givewell.org/research" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tremendous job</a> of evaluating which organizations truly save the most lives. But if that&#x27;s not the road you want to go down, there are plenty of other ways to make a difference in the world. You can volunteer with an organization that you&#x27;re passionate about, vote with your dollar by making ethical purchases, get involved with local politics, engage in good-faith discussions about current issues, and so much more. My goal is not to convince you that there&#x27;s a specific way that you should be giving back to the world (or that you shouldn&#x27;t prioritize your own health and well-being-- you absolutely should), but just to demonstrate that you should care about others, there&#x27;s no good reason to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_nihilism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nihilist</a>, and there are measurable ways to do good in the world. Wherever you are in life, I hope that this inspires you to do the most that you can!</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/notes/docs/Essays/midterms 2022"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">2022 Portland General Election Positions</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/notes/docs/Essays/my views"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">My current views</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#a-quote-on-suffering" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">A quote on suffering</a></li><li><a href="#premise-1-my-well-being-matters" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Premise 1: My well-being matters.</a></li><li><a href="#premise-2-i-dont-matter-more-than-anyone-else" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Premise 2: I don&#39;t matter more than anyone else.</a></li><li><a href="#conclusion-everyones-well-being-matters" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Conclusion: Everyone&#39;s well-being matters.</a></li><li><a href="#contributing-to-everyones-well-being" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Contributing to everyone&#39;s well-being</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/notes/docs/home">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_lCJq"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_lCJq"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_lCJq"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/notes/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_lCJq"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 My Project, Inc.
